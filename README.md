* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
  * it's going to help to investors to quickly get relevants information and the company would be sure that all the information provided by the plataform is arrinving to the right person.


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  * Would be Python and Twillo
  

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  * Python will help to get the data and push to the social media (including Telegram) and also connecting to Twilio to send through whatsApp app
